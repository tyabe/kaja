  <h1>What is Ruby Kaja?</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Ruby Kaja</strong> is a title to recognize people who have contributed to Ruby or the Ruby community
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's commemorate not only those who have made a great contribution, but also those who are not so well known
  </p>
  <p>
    Kaja means 「<%= "#{rubyize '若手', 'わかて'}の#{rubyize '筆頭', 'ひっとう'}" %>」 - literally, the young person's brush tip, and comes from 
    the Kyōgen term Tarō kaja(<%= "#{rubyize '太郎冠者', 'たろうかじゃ'}" %>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Traditionally, the term has been used to refer to young men, but for Ruby Kaja, gender does not matter.
